# COSD Ontology of Sustainable Development
Sustainable development in its various aspects is a multifaceted and contradictory concept, interpreted by multiple sources in all languages. This study exposes the need to explore and develop a productive coevolutionary approach to build modular ontological metamodel of sustainable development including a set of interconnected ontologies and instance databases. Based on a review and analysis of existing ontologies in this area, a methodology for building common ontology of sustainable development is proposed as a top level of the metamodel. Using terminology in well-established and authoritative sources in the field, as well as the methods, resources and standards of Semantic Web, the methodology contains stages: controlled vocabulary and thesaurus creating, ontology formalization, verification, querying and publication. Links with the respective domain and other related to sustainable development ontologies are established. In conclusions, the results and the future development of the ontological metamodel are discussed. 
Keywords: ontology-based modeling, ontology, ontological metamodel, coevolutionary modeling approach, ontology building methodology
